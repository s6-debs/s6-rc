s6-rc - a dependency-based init script management system
--------------------------------------------------------

 s6-rc is a suite of programs designed to help Unix distributions manage
services provided by various software packages, and automate initialization,
shutdown, and more generally changes to the machine state.

 It keeps track of the complete service dependency tree and automatically
brings services up or down to reach the desired state.

 In conjunction with s6, it ensures that long-lived services are
supervised, and that short-lived instructions are run in a reproducible
manner.

 See https://skarnet.org/software/s6-rc/ for details.
